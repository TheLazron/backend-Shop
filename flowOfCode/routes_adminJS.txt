routes/adminJS is supposed to hanndle request pre-concatenated with 'adminJS'
These routes are supposed to indicate that the request is coming from admin dashboard

Path and Express modules are required

Here we also apply usage of router module provided by express.

The Expressrouter object is a collection of middlewares and routes. It a mini-app within the main app.

It itself is a middleware and hence can be used with app.use()

router.get => to handle get request pre-concatenated with '/admin' and
eg. /admin/add-product

Each request here is handled and then passed to the admin Controller that has
middlewares to handle these requests.
adminController custom module is required for that purpose

Atlast the moudule is exported to be used by app.js
