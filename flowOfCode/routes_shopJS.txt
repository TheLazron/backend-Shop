routes/shopJS is supposed to hanndle request that are accessed by general users to visit shop, add porducts to their cart and viewing details.
These routes are supposed to indicate that the request is coming from '/' route and are supposed to handle basic shop functionalities.

Path and Express modules are required

Here we also apply usage of router module provided by express.

The Expressrouter object is a collection of middlewares and routes. It a mini-app within the main app.

It itself is a middleware and hence can be used with app.use()

router.get => to handle get request pre-concatenated with '/admin' and
eg. /cart

Each request here is handled and then passed to the shop Controller that has
middlewares to handle these requests.
shopController custom module is required for that purpose

Atlast the moudule is exported to be used by app.js
